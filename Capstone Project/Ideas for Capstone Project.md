## IDEA 1:  Alt-Coin Opportunity Identification
CryptoCurrencies, originated by Bitcoin in 2009 have recently experienced one of the most explosive bull runs in financial history over the last year.  A large number of alt-coins (the name given to Bitcoin competitors) have appeared on the scene, designed to fix problems of previous CryptoCurrencies, or solve a problem in the global financial markets or online payments system.  Of the 1,000+ alt-coins, there are some with excellent potential, and others that are scams or copycats.  Buyers need to differentiate the wheat from the chaff.  Coins will often initially launch to the market on an ICO at relatively low cost, and based on supply/demand of the marketplace some coins will rise in value, often extremely quickly.  XRP (Ripple) for example, rose 36,018% in 2017 to become the #2 coin by market cap after Bitcoin.  $1,000 invested in XRP would have returned $360,018.  NEM rose 29,842%, Ardor 16,809%, Stellar 14,441%, Dash 9,265%, Ethereum 9,162%, Litecoin 5,046%, and so on.  Bitcoin itself rose 1,318% which is a phenomenal annual return compared to typical financial markets (equities, forex, fixed income, real estate, etc) but not enough to match the 13 alt-coins that surpassed it on a returns basis.

Being able to spot and identify alt-coins with good potential that are rising in favor could be an extremely valuable skill.  Using publicly available data from CryptoCurrency exchanges (price time series data for multiple CryptoCurrencies across multiple exchanges, volume, trends, etc), the data can be analyzed to spot patterns and identify the alt-coins with the most potential early on, thereby allowing the buyer to research the coin and capture the exponential returns as the rest of the market catches on.

## IDEA 2:  Bitcoin or Ethereum Blockchain Analysis
Blockchains have been compared to a decentralized database, and all transactions and history are publicly available for all to see and verify and analyze.  There is a gold mine of data that could be analyzed to uncover useful information.  

For example:  

- With Bitcoin transaction fees rising to $25-$30, that high fee has rendered many accounts incapacitated.  How many accounts are affected by this and is it material compared to the total supply?

- Is it possible to determine what is the active supply of Bitcoin / Ethereum vs amounts that have been lost or are being held long term.

- It is said that a large amount of coins are held by a relatively small number of people.  What does that distribution look like?

- Mining has become more and more centralized in China.  How has that concentration affected the functioning of the network?

- There are more transactions waiting in the Mempool than either Bitcoin or Ethereum network can process.  What does that data flow look like and are there any clues in solving the capacity problem?

## IDEA 3:  Use Machine Learning to "play" retro video games (Atari, NES, etc) and get high scores or finish levels and possibly surpass human ability
Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Neural Networks are evolving and progressing rapidly, with many experts predicting that they will replace up to 50% of human jobs within our lifetimes.  Understanding these powerful tools and having the ability to design and improve them are keys to relevance in a future driven by AI.  

Video games are a perfect sandbox for Artificial Intelligence since there are clearly defined rules, it is easy to quantify and measure progress, and goals/wins/losses are often black and white.  

In this project, I would use AI, Machine Learning and any tools under that umbrella such as Neural Networks in order to learn how to play video games, improve over time, and eventually surpass human ability.
